#Ito, an open source toolkit for financial computing in Julia

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aviks/Ito.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aviks/Ito.jl)

Ito is a collection of Julia modules containing algorithms for efficient quantitative finance. 
It includes functions and frameworks for holiday calendars, day count conventions, term structures, 
stochastic processes and more. 

A lot of the functionality is work in progress, but there are hopefully some useful bits already. 

Detailed documentation is available at http://aviks.github.com/Ito.jl/

##Installation

```julia
Pkg.add("Ito")
```
